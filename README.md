# odin-recipes
This is my first official project I encountered on my journey in following the Odin Project Curriculum in web development.  The project made me use of the skills that I have learned so far.  To be specific, I applied my knowledge in manipulating files and directories through the command line interface, the basics of HTML specifically the creation of a boilerplate and use of tags like headings, paragraphs and lists, and the use of Github and git commands to access repositories and use the features associated with it.  Ace of the future, if you're reading this, I hope you are in a happier place in your life and in a better state of mind.  I hope you find what you are looking for and not feel as lost as you do now.  I will always love you.
